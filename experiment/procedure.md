# Procedure:
1.	Mount the model on the support in the test section and ensure there is no inclination between the body axis and the bed of the test section so that the angle of attack is zero.
2.	Ensure all the fasteners are sufficiently tightened, and no loose or shaking components are in the test section.
3.	Open the pressure control valve to produce supersonic flow in the test section and run the tunnel.
4.	Record the settling chamber pressure to ensure repeatability for other models.
5.	Using the Schlieren imaging setup, record videos for the run of a wind tunnel.
6.	Repeat the procedure for different models and compare the images for different models.
